## Description 
An application where users can submit a form with the dimensions and weight of their Parcel. The site will return the "cost" to ship their Parcel.

## ☕ Setup Instructions ☕

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
3. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "Parcels".
4. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
5. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.
6. Confirm all business logic tests pass with MSTest by running commands (not including the dollar symbol):
`$ dotnet restore ./Parcels.Tests`
`$ dotnet test ./Parcels.Tests`
